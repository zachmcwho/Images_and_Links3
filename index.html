  <h1>Temples are a <img class="house_icon" src="images/house_icon.jpg" alt="house icon"> of God</h1>
  <p>The Lord said, “Build a house to my name, for the Most High to dwell therein” (D&C 124:27). The Lord’s Spirit
    dwells in His temples. The temple is a house of God. It is a place where we make covenants (or promises) with
    Heavenly Father. If we keep our covenants, we will be able to live with Him again.</p>
  <h2>What happens in the temple?</h2>
  <p>Everyone must be baptized to return to Heavenly Father. Many of Heavenly Father’s children died without being
    baptized. After you turn 12, you can be baptized in the temple for those people so they can have the same blessings.

    <h3>Baptism and Confirmation Are Essential</h3>
    <p>The fourth Article of Faith states that the first ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ are “baptism by
      immersion for the remission of sins” and the “laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.” Jesus taught
      that baptism and confirmation are needed for all who want to follow Him and return to our Heavenly Father after
      this life.</p>

    <h3>God Loves All of His Children</h3>
    <p>Every person is a child of God. <em>All</em> are precious to Him. He knows them and He loves them. He declared,
      “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39).
      He has provided a way for all of His children to return to Him after this life. That way is the gospel of Jesus
      Christ</p>
